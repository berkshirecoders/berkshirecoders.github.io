who have chosen to live in this community.

# Rules of Engagement

- Be respectful
- Be curious and open
- Foster dialog
- Provide evidence
- There are no stupid questions

## Be respectful

Personal attacks are not acceptable or tolerated. ("You suck!" is not productive.) Badmouthing employers or colleagues is not 
acceptable or tolerated. ("Tonic 5" only hires lazy programmers, would not be helpful)

Please respect the privacy of others, this includes not sharing these discussions beyond the group. While this is 
by no means a perfectly private discussion, members may share information that could cause real world damage if it were
not in this forum. For example, compromising someone's opportunities to secure a job, or sharing that a certain company 
uses a certain technology could compromise that company's security.

## Be curious and open

The field that we are in changes constantly, and is filled with people who strongly believe in oposing ideas. 
It is unlikely that your opinion or knowledge is correct. This guild is about exploring and constantly being
open to changing your own ideas.


# How we decide things

For now, Asa + Tom decide things.
